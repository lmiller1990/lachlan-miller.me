<h1>2022 in Summary</h1>
<p>2021 was an exciting year for me in several areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>career and OSS</li>
<li>content creation</li>
<li>personal</li>
</ul>
<h1>Career and Software</h1>
<p>I remained at <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a> during 2022. Component Testing, the main product I work on, finally became mature enough to be considered <a href="https://www.cypress.io/blog/2022/11/08/announcing-cypress-11/">&quot;Generally Available&quot;</a>. I also got promoted to &quot;technical lead&quot;. I'll still code a lot, but have more responsibility to plan and drive large technical changes. I also get paid more money.</p>
<p>I continued working on various OSS projects, mainly around Vue, <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils">Test Utils</a> and Cypress. I've also got a few side projects, the most interesting is a rhythm game for the web. The working title is <a href="https://github.com/lmiller1990/eleutheria">Eleutheria</a>.</p>
<h1>Content Creation</h1>
<p>I re-recorded one of my Udemy courses, &quot;Vue.js 3: The Compostion API&quot;. I included a detailed breakdown of how they sold last year, and I'll do the same here. I primarily sell my courses through Udemy now - I get a lesser cut than using Gumroad or my <a href="https://vuejs-course.com">Vue.js Course</a> site, but Udemy's platform has many great features, like Q&amp;A, student communication, etc.</p>
<p>It is difficult to get a proper report of profit / course from Udemy, so I'll just include the combined total for both my courses - &quot;Vue.js: The Composition API&quot; and &quot;Complete Vue.js 3&quot;.</p>

<p>I made <em>more</em> this year, despite spending less time on the courses (I only re-recorded one, and did so in a single week). I hope this will continue - I still intend to re-record my courses to keep them up to date.</p>
<p>My first book, <a href="https://lachlanmiller.gumroad.com/l/vuejs-design-patterns?_gl=1*oxq4yw*_ga*MzgzNDc4NTAuMTYwNDYzNTk4NA..*_ga_6LJN6D94N6*MTY0MTQzNTUzNC4yLjAuMTY0MTQzNTUzNC4w">Design Patterns for Vue.js</a>, continued selling. It's a bit dated now - the ideas are still relevant, but Vuex has been replaced by Pinia, etc. I should update it!</p>

<p>I also solid about $1500 of courses on Gumroad - nice!</p>

<p>$13565 is a non-trivial amount of money - I'm really privledged and honored to make money doing two things I love to do - coding and teaching.</p>
<p>I also continued growing my internet presence via my <a href="https://youtube.com/c/LachlanMiller">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>Nice! I feel like I spent less time on YT content (I could be wrong) in 2022, but my views and subscribers grew. I did &quot;Advent of Vue 2022&quot; towards the end, which led to a big increase in traffic.</p>
<p>I do enjoy making YT content, but I'm getting busier lately and had less time to commit to it. I hope to keep recording content, though, even if it's not on a regular basis.</p>
<h1>Personal</h1>
<p>A big year on a personal basis, too.</p>
<h2>Landscaping</h2>
<p>I finished my landscaping -- or, at least, the turf. Looks great. It took a lot of work - mainly moving soil around. I moved about 40T of soil using a shoel and wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>I learned a lot about communication, empathy and how to be more open minded. Moving into 2023, we decided to shift our focus onto more business focused topics. Our first topic is starting a small project using the philosphies described in The Lean Startup. We are writing a newsletter about Australian Biotech news - you can find the webpage for <a href="https://tbcbio.tech">TBC Bio here</a>.</p>
<p>I also read a bunch of books - not all of these were in 2022, but a lot were:</p>

<h2>Cats</h2>
<p>The cats are doing well. Moa even managed to have one of her <a href="https://twitter.com/bearmoablackcat/status/1612596673863356417">photos go viral</a>!</p>

<h2>Baby</h2>
<p>Our son was born this year! I'm not far in, but so far it's immensely challenging and satisfying.</p>
<h2>Cooking</h2>
<p>I cook most days now. The dishes I am most confident and proud of are easy once - Carbonara and various Risotto dishes. I'd like to keep getting better at cooking.</p>
<h1>Moving Forward</h1>
<p>I'm excited for 2023. I'd like to keep up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>communication skills</li>
<li>content creation, passive income</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as start/continue some new things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm learning more about health care, bio tech and science. My first goal is completing <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/pages/syllabus/">Fundamentals of Biology</a>. I'd like my future career to be in this area.</li>
<li>Do something new. Maybe learn to sing?</li>
<li>Be a good father</li>
<li>Figure out what comes next! I've got a lot going on, but I want to keep pushing myself and learning and growing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Until next year!</p>
