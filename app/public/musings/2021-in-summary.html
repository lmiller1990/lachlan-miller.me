<h1>2021 in Summary</h1>
<p>2021 was an exciting year for me in several areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>career and OSS</li>
<li>content creation</li>
<li>personal</li>
</ul>
<h1>Career and OSS</h1>
<p>I remained at <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a> during 2021. We launched the alpha of our component testing runner, and are working towards GA (general availability).</p>
<p>I also continued working on various OSS projects, mainly around Vue and <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils-next">Test Utils</a>. Test Utils v2 is stable and positioned well moving into 2022, when Vue 3 should become the main version on npm.</p>
<h1>Content Creation</h1>
<p>I re-recorded both of my Udemy courses. They performed really well, I'm really happy to make some money while doing what I love - coding and teaching.</p>

<p>My first book, <a href="https://lachlanmiller.gumroad.com/l/vuejs-design-patterns?_gl=1*oxq4yw*_ga*MzgzNDc4NTAuMTYwNDYzNTk4NA..*_ga_6LJN6D94N6*MTY0MTQzNTUzNC4yLjAuMTY0MTQzNTUzNC4w">Design Patterns for Vue.js</a> also continued to do well, for a total of $5120 during 2021. I sell this via Gumroad. I also made a little on my courses, which are sold via Gumroad in addition to Udemy (Vue.js 3: The Composition API did $1271, and Complete Vue.js did $535).</p>
<p>Total revenue is shown below. I'm excited and honored people are happy to pay for my educational content.</p>

<h1>Personal</h1>
<p>A big year on a personal basis, too. I feel like many years of hard work have finally started to pay off:</p>
<h2>House</h2>
<p>After many years of saving, I purchased a house! Lily did a great job with the interior design. Here are some photos.</p>

<h2>Communication Skills</h2>
<p>I participated in a weekly bookclub with my friends, where we study communication skills, empathy and leadership. I started recording our sessions more diligently around May. Here's a list of books/videos we covered:</p>

<p>I learned a lot about communication, empathy and how to be more open minded. The skills definitely translated into my life - one of the topics, Emotional Intelligence, claimed people with higher EQs generally earn more than their high IQ counter parts. I am earning more than ever and got the biggest raise I've ever received without changing jobs, and I think it's primarily due to my improved soft skills. These skills I've learned are probably the most high impact change of 2021.</p>
<h1>Moving Forward</h1>
<p>I'm excited for 2022. I'd like to keep up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>communication skills</li>
<li>content creation, passive income</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as start some new activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>learning more about home improvement, eg how to build a drain, fix a car, do landscaping, etc.</li>
<li>how to cook better</li>
<li>start a small business (maybe)</li>
<li>start to work out again and improve fitness (mainly via body weight exercises)</li>
<li>continue to build my brand and career</li>
<li>figure out what the heck is next in my life! I feel like I'm living the dream already - generally I like to live by the motto &quot;get comfortable been uncomfortable&quot;, and I'm getting a bit too comfy lately, so I think it's time to change things up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Until next year!</p>
