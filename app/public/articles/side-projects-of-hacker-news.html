<h2>Side Projects of HN making $500 / month</h2>

<p>
I came across an interesting thread on Hacker News recently, where many people share the various
side projects they've created, many of which earn $500+ per month. See the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29667095">
thread here
</a>. I've pulled and summarized the posts here, as ranked by the readers of HN. Each post is followed by a link to
the original thread. Enjoy!

<h2>Project #1</h2><p>I have two!<p>An app for making wedding place cards that does about $1000/mo <a href="https://www.placecard.me/" rel="nofollow">https://www.placecard.me/</a><p>A boilerplate for making SaaS apps with Python/Django that does $5k/month (highly variable) <a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.saaspegasus.com/</a><p>I also have a third that does around $150/mo. It's an app that adds analytics to GroupMe which is a WhatsApp alternative. <a href="https://chatstats.co/" rel="nofollow">https://chatstats.co/</a><p>I keep complete revenue and effort data here if you're curious: <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open/" rel="nofollow">https://www.coryzue.com/open/</a></p>

It’s a simple book with buttons and LEDs to demonstrate different logic gates.<p>I just shipped out the first batch of books a week ago and now waiting for the next batch of books. It’s gotten pretty demanding pretty quickly but I’m really excited about it. I’m hoping I can soon employ my little sister to manage all the shipping. She’s been an Amazon driver for the last 2 years and I think she’d appreciate a change of pace.</p>
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29668312">View full story on HN.</a><hr /><h2>Project #3</h2><p>I have about 6 years of applied AI experience and I have been trying to work on something that can use that experience and be useful to others.<p>Ended up building an analytics based platform that uses data analysis techniques to generate trade ideas for retail investors [0]. Started it as a hobby July 2019, but it ended up growing quite big. The plan was to generate about $1k/mo but we are generating about $120k/mo these days with over 3000 paid users. I think I'm the most fortunate person in the world, never in my wildest dreams did I imagine this much.<p>I still work on it solo and have no plans on hiring a team, because solo is where I have most fun, and that's important.<p>[0] <a href="https://tradytics.com" rel="nofollow">https://tradytics.com</a></p>

Annualized it makes around $800 / month and growing. Should double to $1600 / month next year as we’ve doubled our production. It’s barely profitable, but is profitable nonetheless. The more we plant the more profitable it will get, and we’ll be planting 10,000 more trees soon!</p>
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29668530">View full story on HN.</a><hr /><h2>Project #5</h2><p>Open Source Hardware!<p>Specifically a USB Oscilloscope:<p><a href="https://espotek.com/labrador" rel="nofollow">https://espotek.com/labrador</a><p>Sell maybe $1k/mo of these through the website and another $3k through Amazon at a margin of around 50%.<p>The biggest things that I see a lot of people get wrong in the hardware business is the importance of manufacturing and logistics.  It doesn't matter that you're constantly producing new and improved revisions of your board if you're out of stock all the time and overseas customers have to pay extra for shipping.</p>
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29669201">View full story on HN.</a><hr /><h2>Project #6</h2><p>I built a board game in 2021 that has been just breaking the cutoff for this post, all I do is mail out a few games a week as we get orders. We do all our own fulfillment to save money. Currently trying to design a real video game. I got lucky with the board game because it targeted a really niche audience (rock climbers) and so we weren't really competing with the full board game market, which is honestly super saturated. I think launching a real video game will require taking a similar strategy, and I have some good ideas for this. If you know how to do 3D modeling and animation and have always wanted to make a game as a side project, send a message.<p>For anybody thinking of following on this path, I would say it's not really worth it except as a fun hobby. I didn't keep track of hours designing/testing very well but we're almost certainly way below minimum wage on the project. Although I've learned a lot about how to make games which has been really cool. You'll make a lot more money if you don't have to manufacture a real product and deal with the high costs of freight and postal shipping. If anybody is curious you can look up "5.15 climbing card game" on google and you'll find it!</p>

In 2021, I earned $4761, which means ~$400/month. It's not horribly little amount, especially for Russia (where I live), given it's a side project. However, I feel I need to do something more active, rather than just drawing new pictures.<p>Promoting and marketing is alien space for me (as well as for many other designers and developers here, I'm certain). Please wish me luck promoting and marketing my art in 2022 :-)<p>[0] <a href="https://vlad.studio/" rel="nofollow">https://vlad.studio/</a></p>

Or maybe one really has to take the leap of faith and trust that there is demand for virtually anything?<p>Maybe it’s not so simple, my partner opened a small e-commerce store selling some genuinely nice craft she produces, and has been seeing $0 revenues even with some aggressive ads campaigns, so go figure.<p>My job currently compensates me above $1M a year depending on stock price (public FAANG company), so I never even considered it worthwhile to invest my evening/weekend time in a side project, and always funneled every second of non-recreational time back into my job. But maybe I’ve been doing it all wrong when I see people bringing in several thousands a month for minimal time investment after the product is stabilized.<p>To somewhat answer the thread: my “side project” is my investment portfolio of boring index funds, where I funnel all my savings. This year is up about 15% (unrealized gains) and realized income of ~$50k via dividends.<p>Certainly huge congratulations to the business owners, very humbling thread.</p>

I stopped working professionally 3 years ago.<p>Bought an e-commerce business that was making ~$2k/mo profit and ran it on the side while I had my DevOps job.<p>That project has now turned into ~$30k/mo profit, and I've bought two more e-com businesses that average ~$10k/mo between the two - these are early and I expect them to scale up once I smooth out a few bumps.<p>I go through phases of a lot of work, and next to no work. Depends if I'm busy on growing the businesses or just want to enjoy the income. I'm out of 95% of the day-to-day operations and I have a team of 3 that handle most things.</p>
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29668604">View full story on HN.</a><hr /><h2>Project #10</h2><p>I started an OSS project to enable me and my team to receive webhooks at a big co where Ngrok was banned and so was SSH. It works over an HTTP proxy using websockets. One of the requirements I had was for 1st class container support - so it could be run inside a K8s pod and support LoadBalancers for TCP traffic as well as HTTPS. The OSS project was very popular, but drew very little sponsorship. I then pivoted to a commercial license and got some more sign-ups, but not as many as I wanted - companies were happy to pay up front for a one year static license, but individuals and home users were not.<p>So I introduced a personal tier that was covered for commercial use - inspired by Jetbrains and added a monthly subscription option for it. Both of those actions helped increase usage and signups with personal users. Companies still tend to want to pay for a year.<p>Even though this is completely self-hosted software, developers seem to like paying for tools monthly. Some abuse this by cancelling the subscription in the months they don't expect to use a tunnel, or opening the software then cancelling the subscription and waiting until the process has to restart before re-subscribing. Not much I can do about this side of it.<p>If people are interested, the product is called inlets and is easy to find on the Internet. I also write about my OSS and independent business work each week in a subscription newsletter using GitHub Sponsors (another side project, if you like)<p>Books I could recommend: Monetizing innovation, Obviously Awesome, 1-Page Marketing Plan & Minimalist Entrepreneur. I'm not affiliated with any of these titles, but consider them core reading for indie devs and for side gigs.</p>

This does enable all sort of interesting use case. For example, the mysql implementation shows database name as first level folder, tables as second level folders and each row in a table is shown as a file within the table folder which a user can edit directly through the generated form built from the schema information. That way people who are used to the Dropbox interface can edit the database directly, create shared links, search through stuff without having to know about sql<p>Most of the money comes from companies who needed various degree of customisation and support or didn't want to host on premise.</p>

I created it because I wasn't drinking enough water.<p>Running paid ads has been very hit or miss, and I don't have a knack for the marketing. But word-of-mouth has been good for us and we get the odd corporate sale here or there.</p>

<a href="https://www.escape-team.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.escape-team.com</a><p>All revenue is generated via in-app purchases, and it is about 60% iOS, 40% Android.<p>People download and print a mission PDF with all the physical cut-fold-and-draw puzzles, then the app offers a $1.99 in-app purchase to unlock the audio narrative/gameplay for that mission. Most revenue comes from mission packs, which are $6.99 for four missions.<p>I am doing zero advertisement, if just works by word of mouth. I think that is because the game is a very fun and social activity. I also see hundreds (!) of custom missions being created for Christmas in the Mission Editor, there seem to be a lot of escape room-savvy Santas this year.</p>

Then, I create a MVP frontend in react and add ads from adsense. Now it's making $400/month.<p>I love it because is 100% passive.

Bought a Quest 2 the other day and didn't give it much thought, partly because of little eggs like this.<p>The effort to grow it is pretty high relative to the returns, but it's also a lot more "sticky." Normal profit streams dry up if you ignore them, whereas I've had my band of faithful patrons for a long time now. People just like supporting those doing work that resonates with them.</p>

Deployed about 8 years ago. Two employees, myself and my brother. Built it in php, and javascript and was the first web based app I had ever built. Got paid about 150k to build it and then we have been netting ~$2500 a month (we then split it 50/50) for the last 8 years. No upgrades or additional work done. Most months all I do is send in the invoice. Hardest part was remembering to renew the ssl cert each year. This month was the last month as the company has switched to a standard solution across all their departments. Was a good ride now I have to figure out something else to build. Worked a regular job this whole time as well.</p>

Profit margins are paper thin (ha!). Still though, it's been fun putting together the website, integrating Stripe etc.<p>Biggest issue is book publishers. Wow their ordering systems are archaic!<p>We can't hold stock on hand because we don't know how many subscribers we'll have each month. The issue with not holding stock is that we can't get reliable stock levels from <i>any</i> publisher or distributor. Ordering is a matter of emailing asking for a stock list, waiting to receive the stock list, then sending an email placing the order as quickly as possible. Frequently we'll order only to have them tell us books we ordered are on back order and we'll receive them in a month or two. It doesn't matter how often we say we can't do this, they don't care. I just want to get in there and build real-time stock management and ordering for them!<p>This is made substantially harder by the fact my wife creates associated resources and activities for each book. We can't deliver different books to different subscribers because she'd then need to produce additional activities & resources for each of the books. There's already 8 different books each month.</p>

    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29667970">View full story on HN.</a><hr /><h2>Project #25</h2><p>My 'side project' is pretty conventional, but it surprises people to learn how much I've earned from it with <i>very</i> little effort. At least once or twice a week, I use my lunch break to walk to the local thrift store. I look up items on eBay as I browse and buy anything that would net me $20+ (basically to cover my lunch). I stick to the 'hard goods' section (things like electronics, games, DVDs, home appliances, books, etc). I avoid clothing which is difficult to browse quickly, difficult to list and difficult to find comparable items. I also avoid anything that would be unwieldy to carry home or ship.<p>The first year I started doing this, I grossed about $20000. Last year was bad. Our thrift stores shut down because of Covid. In late June of this year, I started back up slowly because our thrift stores came back. My gross for the last six months is $3,238.63. And again, because of Covid, I've stopped going daily like I was which cut into my fun money.<p>Last year I bought a brand new pinball machine from my thrift store finds.<p>Some tips:<p>If you can go every day, you only have to look at the 'new' stuff which saves lots of time.<p>The eBay app has a barcode scanner so you can look up anything that's in its original packaging by just scanning it.<p>Don't pass up anything vintage looking that's still sealed (even if it looks worthless). I sold nearly $100 worth of new in package vintage incandescent bulbs a little while back. I got the lot of them for like $10.<p>Save all the boxes you have coming to your house in advance of starting this. You can't sell stuff that you can't easily box up and ship.<p>Never use the post office or UPS/FedEx store. You can get a significant discount through pirateship.com (free to use, offers steep US Postal and UPS discounts) or even eBay's own shipping.<p>EDIT: A few more tips...<p>Once you're shipping at least one thing a week, buy a label printer like a Rollo Thermal Printer. It will save you lots of wasted time and energy in printing out, cutting the shipping label to size, taping it to the package securely, etc.<p>Invest in a good industrial shipping tape gun (not those cheap little plastic ones), get good brand-name shipping tape and a couple of large rolls of bubble wrap... also, start saving the packaging that comes into your house from your online purchases to be reused.<p>Get a bunch of 'newsprint' packing paper for packing up your stuff.<p>Basically: don't cheap out on supplies.<p>Stay organized. I use a set of plastic bins in the basement to store my items once they're listed.</p>

Then covid came around and dried up most of my consulting income, so I figured why not really prioritize it and see how far it can go?  Still small, but growing nicely now.<p>Also reluctantly abandoned the flawed "build it and they will come" mentality and started splitting time evenly between development and marketing.  This has probably contributed more to the project's recent growth than several thousand hours of dev time.  Take heed, o ye ambitious developer-founders! :-)  Recommended resources: Product-Led Growth, Developer Marketing Does Not Exist, 80/20 Sales and Marketing, BusinessOfSoftware.org talk videos, Microconf talk videos (on YouTube).</p>

However, given that I put in less than 6 hours a week on it (working less and taking a smaller cut of profits), it still feels like a side project.<p>We started in January and are now at ~30k a month and growing steadily. Our revenue streams are split by ad revenue, patreon, sponsorships, and other various income split somewhat evenly. It took a year of working with seeing no profits, but now we are growing at a steady pace and just hired our first employee (an analyst, we are a finance youtube channel)! We see it more an an e-learning company with youtube as it’s main marketing base, as we are building out career courses (for investment banking and MBA stuff), a newsletter, and sites for helping people with their investments.<p>I’m the editor, and I vastly cut down my editing time by building out a program that does most of the editing for me using ffmpeg to automate 80% of the work. A video that might take 8 hours to edit only takes me 2 hours, and I think thats the biggest reason it feels like a sideproject still because of the optimized workflow.</p>

Been working on it for 2 years now. I started it while attending university as a side-project, but now my studies have definitely taken a step back. That has allowed me to get the business to around $1500/month (bad months are $500, best month was $4000). That's been possible due to free education in Germany and me being able to move back in with my parents during covid while still attending online lectures.

Each comes with a dedicated anycast IP address so that your users can point an apex A record at it and be geo routed to the nearest region of your cluster.<p>You can add virtual hosts for domains, subdomains, or specific paths through a really simple API and it'll handle SSL and verification automatically in a few seconds during the first request.<p>It's been really fun to work on, plenty of hard problems to solve and it's been really useful to people, including myself. I had a baby boy this summer so I've had roughly zero time to market it in any way but there's still tens of thousands of domains running through approximated clusters now so it's been growing a little bit at a time on its own.<p>Current future plans are for edge caching (nearly done), ddos mitigation, and then hopefully something more interesting like colocating serverless workers or distributed apps maybe.</p>

The content in question is threads on AskReddit. I know a lot of people look down on content like that (tbh myself included) but to be fair most content on YouTube is very low-effort. It's not getting close to the views it used to, but now it makes an average of about $1k/month.<p>Our content is a lot higher quality than most other similar channels, mainly because the software I made automates so much. Which is why I think this one stood out. I effectively spend an hour a month or so just maintaining the software, while the actual work of uploading/making thumbnails is outsourced to someone I know. He spends maybe 15 minutes per video and we upload daily. It's a fun side-business to have but I don't expect it to be viable long-term unless I somehow pivot it into something else.</p>

Slowly, over months, I started to build a reputation and build a userbase.<p>Profits range between 1000$-1800$ and I'm planning to expand to other marketplaces (I have a lot of customer who are on Shopify, even if I don't offer a Shopify app) and build other APIs. Hopefully I'll have more time once my sons go to nursery / school.<p>I use Stripe for direct sales on the website and RapidAPI (ex Mashape) as a marketplace.<p>I can't say RapidAPI is been smooth sailing: their payment processing is riddled with fees (thanks PayPal) and there are frequent outages and issues with their proxy.
Still, I think using a marketplace can be a decent approach for developers who don't want to spend their days on reddit or finding their clients.</p>
