# 2021 in Summary

2021 was an exciting year for me in several areas:

- career and OSS
- content creation
- personal

# Career and OSS

I remained at [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) during 2021. We launched the alpha of our component testing runner, and are working towards GA (general availability).

I also continued working on various OSS projects, mainly around Vue and [Test Utils](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils-next). Test Utils v2 is stable and positioned well moving into 2022, when Vue 3 should become the main version on npm.

# Content Creation

I re-recorded both of my Udemy courses. They performed really well, I'm really happy to make some money while doing what I love - coding and teaching.

| Course | Description | Rating | Revenue |
| --- | ----------- | ----- | -------|
| Complete Vue.js | [Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-vuejs-3-crash-course-composition-api-vue-router-vuex/) | 4.6 (570 ratings) | $4259
| Vue.js 3: The Composition API | [Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-3-the-composition-api/) | 4.6 (139 ratings) | $3708

My first book, [Design Patterns for Vue.js](https://lachlanmiller.gumroad.com/l/vuejs-design-patterns?_gl=1*oxq4yw*_ga*MzgzNDc4NTAuMTYwNDYzNTk4NA..*_ga_6LJN6D94N6*MTY0MTQzNTUzNC4yLjAuMTY0MTQzNTUzNC4w) also continued to do well, for a total of $5120 during 2021. I sell this via Gumroad. I also made a little on my courses, which are sold via Gumroad in addition to Udemy (Vue.js 3: The Composition API did $1271, and Complete Vue.js did $535).

Total revenue is shown below. I'm excited and honored people are happy to pay for my educational content.

| Platform | Revenue | 
| --- | ----------- |
| Udemy | $8040  |
| Gumroad | $6981.50 |

I also continued growing my internet presence via my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/LachlanMiller).

# Personal

A big year on a personal basis, too. I feel like many years of hard work have finally started to pay off:

## House

After many years of saving, I purchased a house! Lily did a great job with the interior design. Here are some photos.

I learned a lot about communication, empathy and how to be more open minded. The skills definitely translated into my life - one of the topics, Emotional Intelligence, claimed people with higher EQs generally earn more than their high IQ counter parts. I am earning more than ever and got the biggest raise I've ever received without changing jobs, and I think it's primarily due to my improved soft skills. These skills I've learned are probably the most high impact change of 2021.

# Moving Forward

I'm excited for 2022. I'd like to keep up with:

- communication skills
- content creation, passive income

As well as start some new activities:

- learning more about home improvement, eg how to build a drain, fix a car, do landscaping, etc.
- how to cook better
- start a small business (maybe)
- start to work out again and improve fitness (mainly via body weight exercises)
- continue to build my brand and career
- figure out what the heck is next in my life! I feel like I'm living the dream already - generally I like to live by the motto "get comfortable been uncomfortable", and I'm getting a bit too comfy lately, so I think it's time to change things up.

Until next year!
