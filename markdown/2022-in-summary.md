# 2022 in Summary

2021 was an exciting year for me in several areas:

- career and OSS
- content creation
- personal

# Career and Software

I remained at [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) during 2022. Component Testing, the main product I work on, finally became mature enough to be considered ["Generally Available"](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2022/11/08/announcing-cypress-11/). I also got promoted to "technical lead". I'll still code a lot, but have more responsibility to plan and drive large technical changes. I also get paid more money.

I continued working on various OSS projects, mainly around Vue, [Test Utils](https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils) and Cypress. I've also got a few side projects, the most interesting is a rhythm game for the web. The working title is [Eleutheria](https://github.com/lmiller1990/eleutheria).

# Content Creation

I re-recorded one of my Udemy courses, "Vue.js 3: The Compostion API". I included a detailed breakdown of how they sold last year, and I'll do the same here. I primarily sell my courses through Udemy now - I get a lesser cut than using Gumroad or my [Vue.js Course](https://vuejs-course.com) site, but Udemy's platform has many great features, like Q&A, student communication, etc.

It is difficult to get a proper report of profit / course from Udemy, so I'll just include the combined total for both my courses - "Vue.js: The Composition API" and "Complete Vue.js 3".

| Year | Net Earnings |
| --- | ----------- | 
|  2021 | $7967 |
|  2022 | $9087 |

I made *more* this year, despite spending less time on the courses (I only re-recorded one, and did so in a single week). I hope this will continue - I still intend to re-record my courses to keep them up to date.

My first book, [Design Patterns for Vue.js](https://lachlanmiller.gumroad.com/l/vuejs-design-patterns?_gl=1*oxq4yw*_ga*MzgzNDc4NTAuMTYwNDYzNTk4NA..*_ga_6LJN6D94N6*MTY0MTQzNTUzNC4yLjAuMTY0MTQzNTUzNC4w), continued selling. It's a bit dated now - the ideas are still relevant, but Vuex has been replaced by Pinia, etc. I should update it!

| Year | Net Earnings |
| --- | ----------- | 
|  2021 | $5120  |
|  2022 | $2749 |

I also solid about $1500 of courses on Gumroad - nice! 

My total earnings for 2021 vs 2022:

| Year | Net Earnings |
| --- | ----------- | 
|  2021 | $15021  |
|  2022 | $13565 |

$13565 is a non-trivial amount of money - I'm really privledged and honored to make money doing two things I love to do - coding and teaching.

I also continued growing my internet presence via my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/LachlanMiller). 

Here's a graphic:

Nice! I feel like I spent less time on YT content (I could be wrong) in 2022, but my views and subscribers grew. I did "Advent of Vue 2022" towards the end, which led to a big increase in traffic.

I do enjoy making YT content, but I'm getting busier lately and had less time to commit to it. I hope to keep recording content, though, even if it's not on a regular basis.

# Personal

A big year on a personal basis, too.

## Borders are Open!

The world is slowly starting to open up again. I went to South Korea and watched the LOL MSI 2022 event in Busan!

## Landscaping

I finished my landscaping -- or, at least, the turf. Looks great. It was a lot of work - mainly moving soil around. I moved about 40T of soil using a shoel and wheelbarrow.

I learned a lot about communication, empathy and how to be more open minded. Moving into 2023, we decided to shift our focus onto more business focused topics. Our first topic is starting a small project using the philosphies described in The Lean Startup. We are writing a newsletter about Australian Biotech news - you can find the webpage for [TBC Bio here](https://tbcbio.tech).

I also read a bunch of books - not all of these were in 2022, but a lot were:

## Cats

The cats are doing well. Moa even managed to have one of her [photos go viral](https://twitter.com/bearmoablackcat/status/1612596673863356417)!

## Baby

Our son was born this year! I'm not far in, but so far it's immensely challenging and satisfying.

## Cooking

I cook most days now. The dishes I am most confident and proud of are easy once - Carbonara and various Risotto dishes. I'd like to keep getting better at cooking.

# Moving Forward

I'm excited for 2023. I'd like to keep up with:

- communication skills
- content creation, passive income

As well as start/continue some new things:

- I'm learning more about health care, bio tech and science. My first goal is completing [Fundamentals of Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/pages/syllabus/). I'd like my future career to be in this area.
- Do something new. Maybe learn to sing?
- Be a good father
- Figure out what comes next! I've got a lot going on, but I want to keep pushing myself and learning and growing.

Until next year!
